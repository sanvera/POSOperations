# POSOperations
POS Operations is a Web API project designed by Abdurrahman Sanver.

## Information 
Swagger IO is installed with Swashbuckle to run API calls from UI. 
So, basically, start running the WebAPI project and test the API calls from the UI.

This project uses SQLite set up for in-memory DB use inside configurations file.
So when you compile and run the project and send API requests; it gets, inserts or modifies the data using the advantages of Dapper, which is very fast compared to other ORMs, to temporary tables created on your memory and when you stop running the project it wipes up all temporary data from your memory.

### Code Coverage
43 Unit tests and 26 Integration tests coded around the source code not to miss the worst-case scenarios.
